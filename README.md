# Description
Recipe Wizard is a site in which the user can receive suggested recipes based on a certain number of criteria: amount of calories, time of day, type of meal, and also diet restrictions. In addition, we are able to suggest cookbooks for those who need additional recipes.

Due to the pandemic, many of us have started to cook at home. By developing Recipe Wizard, the average person can look up recipes with ease while also including their preferences in one site. 

# USER STORY
AS A homecook 
I WANT a recipe that fulfills my nutritional needs
SO THAT I can plan a meal efficiently
GIVEN a webpage that meets my recipe needs
WHEN I give specificifications about the time of day, the minimum/maximum calories, and dish type

# Directions for future deployment
1.More preferences may be added to further allow users to modify their recipe suggestions.
2.A bookmarking system in which users can save their favorite recipes
3.Adding options to share recipe suggestions to others via social media accounts.
